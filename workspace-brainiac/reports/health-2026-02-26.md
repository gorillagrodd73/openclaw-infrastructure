## Error Analysis

### Critical Errors Found: 10

**Type 1: LLM Request Timeouts (FailoverError)**
- Multiple occurrences in last 24h
- Affects: `main` lane, `discord` channel lane, `cron` lane
- Impact: Agent tasks failing due to LLM service unavailability

**Type 2: Discord Access Errors ("Missing Access")**
- Subagent completion announcements failing
- Multiple failed runs with permission issues
- Impact: Task completion notifications not being delivered

### Sample Errors:
```
FailoverError: LLM request timed out. (600s+ duration)
Subagent completion direct announce failed... Error: Missing Access
```

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Deploy Riddler agent** — Output directory missing; agent may not be initialized
2. **Review Discord permissions** — "Missing Access" errors indicate bot lacks channel permissions for announcements
3. **Monitor LLM timeouts** — Frequent timeouts suggest provider (moonshotai/kimi-k2.5) connectivity issues

### System Improvements
1. Implement retry logic for LLM requests with exponential backoff
2. Verify Discord bot token has proper permissions (Send Messages, Read Message History)
3. Add health check alerting for missing agent directories
4. Consider fallback LLM provider if timeouts persist
