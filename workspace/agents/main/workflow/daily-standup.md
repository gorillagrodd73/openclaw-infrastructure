--- name: Daily Standup Meeting description: Collects agent reports, analyzes for critical issues, facilitates solution discussions, and summarizes for Calous agent: main type: manual tags: [standup, reports, management, morning, coordination] --- # Daily Standup Meeting Aggregates daily reports from all agents, identifies critical issues, and coordinates solutions. ## Trigger Run at 6:00 AM PST daily via cron. ## Scope Collect and process reports from: - Other agents' report storage locations - Previous day's memory files - Any agent-generated reports in `.openclaw/workspace-*/reports/` ## Report Sources ### 1. Brainiac Reports | Location | Pattern | Priority | |----------|---------|----------| | `~/.openclaw/workspace-brainiac/reports/` | `agent-health-YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` | High | | `~/.openclaw/workspace-brainiac/reports/` | `openclaw-health-YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` | High | ### 2. Other Agent Reports | Location | Pattern | Priority | |----------|---------|----------| | `~/.openclaw/workspace-{agent}/reports/` | `*-YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` | Medium | ### 3. Memory / Daily Logs | Location | Pattern | Purpose | |----------|---------|----------| | `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/` | `YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Raw activity logs | ## Steps ### 1. Enumerate Reports Collect all reports generated in the last 24 hours: ```bash # Find all reports from yesterday and today find ~/.openclaw/workspace-*/reports/ -name "*.md" -mtime -1 -ls ``` ### 2. Read and Analyze For each report found: 1. **Extract key information:** - Report title and agent - Status (Healthy/Warning/Critical) - Severity counts by level - Action items requiring attention - Self-improvement questions/insights 2. **Classify by criticality:** - 🔴 **CRITICAL** — Immediate action required, system affected - 🟡 **WARNING** — Attention needed, degrading performance - 🟢 **INFO** — FYI, no action required 3. **Identify blockers:** - What is preventing optimal operation? - Are there dependencies between agents? - Are resources constrained? ### 3. Generate Standup Summary Structure the summary report: ```markdown # Daily Standup Report — YYYY-MM-DD **Generated:** 6:15 AM PST **Reports Analyzed:** N **Agents Checked:** N ## Executive Summary 1-2 sentences on overall system health. Example: "All systems nominal. Brainiac detected 1 new directory in .openclaw/, investigation pending." ## Critical Issues (if any) ### 🔴 Issue 1 **Agent:** [agent name] **Severity:** CRITICAL **Description:** What the problem is **Impact:** What will break if not fixed **Location:** Where to find full details **Recommended Action:** Next step ## Warnings and Observations ### 🟡 Observation 1 **Agent:** [agent name] **Severity:** WARNING **Description:** What was found **Trend:** Is this recurring? **Recommendation:** What to watch ## System Insights **From Brainiac:** [Insights from health check questions] **From Other Agents:** [Any process improvements suggested] ## Actions Taken / Planned | Action | Owner | Status | Notes | |--------|-------|--------|-------| | | | | | ## Agent Coordination If critical issues exist, coordinate with agents for solutions: 1. Spawn relevant agents in isolated sessions 2. Present the problem 3. Request solution proposals 4. Evaluate proposals 5. Select best solution and implement 6. Document in Actions Taken --- *Standup completed* 🦍 ``` ### 4. Coordinate Solutions (Conditional) If critical issues found: 1. **Identify relevant agents** — Which agent(s) can address this? 2. **Spawn solution sessions:** ```bash # For each relevant agent sessions_spawn --agent {agent} --task "Critical issue identified: [description]. Propose a solution for [specific problem]. Include implementation steps, risks, and expected outcome." ``` 3. **Collect proposals** — Wait for agent responses 4. **Evaluate** — Compare proposals by: - Feasibility - Risk level - Resource requirements - Time to implement - Alignment with system architecture 5. **Select best solution** — Document decision rationale 6. **Implement** — Execute the chosen solution 7. **Verify** — Confirm fix resolved the issue 8. **Report** — Note implementation in standup summary ### 5. Deliver Report Send the completed standup summary to Discord via webhook: - **Webhook URL:** `https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/1475159106800062594/QI9DuxTmSrpXuuJDi4htNQBcKbWbZjrkfyXf-zrdfwBB8mad28WweQHxQ2vMZjWDnsUB` - **Channel:** Status Reports (via webhook) - **Mention:** @Calous - **Format:** Concise summary with link to full report - **Delivery method:** Use `exec` with `curl` to POST the formatted summary as JSON payload to the webhook Example payload structure: ```bash curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"content": "**Daily Standup — YYYY-MM-DD**\n\n🟡 Status: WARNING\n\nKey items...\n\nFull report: <path>"}' "https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/1475159106800062594/QI9DuxTmSrpXuuJDi4htNQBcKbWbZjrkfyXf-zrdfwBB8mad28WweQHxQ2vMZjWDnsUB" ``` ## Critical Issue Response Flow ``` Detect Critical Issue ↓ Spawn Agents ↓ Get Proposals ↓ Evaluate & Choose ↓ Implement Fix ↓ Verify Resolved ↓ Report to Calous ``` ## Report Storage Save standup summaries for historical tracking: ``` ~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/standups/ └── standup-YYYY-MM-DD.md ``` ## Success Criteria - ✅ All agent reports from last 24 hours reviewed - ✅ Critical issues identified and flagged - ✅ Solutions coordinated for critical issues (if any) - ✅ Calous notified via Discord webhook with summary - ✅ Standup summary archived for reference - ✅ Any implemented solutions documented ## Error Handling If no reports found: - Check file permissions - Verify agent report directories exist - Note in standup: "No reports available for review" - Check if agents are running properly If unable to spawn agents for solutions: - Note in standup: "Solution coordination deferred" - Escalate to Calous with options - Schedule follow-up If Discord webhook delivery fails: - Save to standup archive anyway - Retry delivery using Discord channel as fallback - Notify via alternative channel if urgent ## Continuous Improvement After each standup, consider: - Are reports too verbose/too terse? - Are critical issues being missed? - Could standup timing be optimized? - Do solution proposals need more structure? ## Weekly Rollup (Advanced - optional) On Sundays, generate weekly summary: - Trends across the week - Recurring issues - System stability metrics - Agent productivity indicators --- *Starting the day with clarity* 🦍
